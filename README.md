This program is for a fictional grocery store that has a .txt file of items sold on a given day. They needed a program to analyze this data in various ways.
the program prints a menu of four options sees a list and counts each item search the count of a specific item and print a graph of the items and the number sold.
I think this program is well modularized and utilizes Python and C++ well.
The program reads the file each time a Python function is called. It would be better if it was only needed once.
Having Python write the .dat file was difficult for me I accidentally had the file creation in the write loop. I looked at some writing to a file example son stack overflow to solve the issue.
The modularization of this project will be very helpful in the future I even was able to modify functions from previous projects to use in this one and I would be willing to bet I will be able to in the future as well. 
Thanks to the modularization and in-line notes it's easy to change or update any part of the program like I said before I could even use the functions in entirely other projects if needed.


The 7-1.rar contains a 3D environment containing recreated objects from my office and attempts to create realistic texturing and lighting through multiple sources and header files the user can float around and view the objects from any angle using WASD controls.

I have also included several sln files named for data structures that include sorting and displaying the data among these is a console application file that has a menu allowing for CSV files of course data to be loaded into the data structure and have it displayed or searched based on a course code
